# Pendo Helper

A Visual Studio Code Extension that creates a random string that you can use as a unique css class for easier Pendo tracking.

Open the Command Palette (Windows: CTRL+SHIFT+P, Mac: CMD+SHIFT+P) and type in Pendo.
You ll get two available commands, Pendo Class that inserts a class with a unique string and Pendo Ignore that inserts a class that is used by Pendo to [exlude tracking](https://support.pendo.io/hc/en-us/community/posts/6068892939163-Tech-Note-Excluding-specific-elements-from-tracking-in-Pendo) of those elements.
